### The Impact of Military Status on Income Bracket

##### Joey Maalouf

Using the [National Health Interview Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2015_data_release.htm) data, I was able to look for a potential link between military status and financial status. More specifically, I wanted to check if whether someone served in the United States military affects their current income bracket. It was apparent that people who served in the military were underrepresented in low income brackets and overrepresented in high income brackets compared to the rest of the population. This difference appears more clearly if we group the income data into even broader brackets for further analysis; splitting at the middle of our income data results in almost two-thirds of the military respondents making above the threshold, with the corresponding ratio for non-military respondents being just below half. Further statistical analysis reported a Cohen effect size of 0.32, which is above the standard threshold to be considered more than a small effect.
