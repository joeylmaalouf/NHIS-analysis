### The Impact of Military Status on Income Bracket

##### Joey Maalouf

Using the [National Health Interview Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2015_data_release.htm) data, I was able to look for a potential link between military status and financial status. More specifically, I wanted to check if whether someone served in the United States military affects their current income bracket. It was apparent that people who served in the military were underrepresented in low income brackets and overrepresented in high income brackets compared to the rest of the population. This difference appears more clearly if we group the income data into even broader brackets for further analysis; being in the military increased one's chances of being in the upper half of respondents by 16.06 percentage points, and of being in the upper third by 14.64 percentage points. Further statistical analysis reported a Cohen effect size of 0.32, which is above the standard threshold to be considered more than a small effect.
